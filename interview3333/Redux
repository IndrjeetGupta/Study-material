What is Redux?

Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. It helps manage application state in a centralized store using actions and reducers.

What are the core principles of Redux?

Single source of truth

State is read-only

Changes are made with pure functions (reducers)

What are the main components of Redux?

Store

Actions

Reducers

What is an action in Redux?

An object that describes an event or intention to change the state. It must have a type property.

What is a reducer?

A pure function that takes the current state and an action, and returns the new state.

What is the Redux store?

A centralized place that holds the application state and provides methods like dispatch, getState, and subscribe.

üîπ Intermediate Level
What is the purpose of dispatch() in Redux?

dispatch() sends an action to the reducer to update the state.

What is middleware in Redux?

Middleware provides a way to interact with actions before they reach the reducer‚Äîused for async logic, logging, etc. (e.g., redux-thunk, redux-saga)

What is redux-thunk?

A middleware that lets you write action creators that return a function instead of an action‚Äîcommonly used for handling async operations.

How do you handle asynchronous actions in Redux?

Using middleware like redux-thunk or redux-saga.

Can you explain the flow of data in Redux?

UI ‚ûù dispatch(action) ‚ûù middleware (if any) ‚ûù reducer ‚ûù new state ‚ûù UI re-renders

What is the difference between mapStateToProps and mapDispatchToProps?

mapStateToProps: maps state from the store to component props.

mapDispatchToProps: maps dispatch actions to component props.

What are selectors in Redux?

Functions used to derive or extract specific parts of the state, often using reselect for memoization.

What are some alternatives to Redux?

Context API, Zustand, Recoil, Jotai, MobX, XState

What problems can Redux introduce if misused?

Overhead for small apps, boilerplate code, tightly coupled logic if not well organized.

How do you persist state in Redux?

Using libraries like redux-persist to save the Redux store to localStorage or sessionStorage.

What is the difference between Redux Toolkit and plain Redux?

Redux Toolkit is the official, recommended way to write Redux logic. It reduces boilerplate, includes createSlice, createAsyncThunk, and built-in dev tools support.
