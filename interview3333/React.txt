1. What is Reconciliation in React?
Answer:
Reconciliation is the process where React updates the DOM efficiently. React uses the Virtual DOM and a diffing algorithm to compare previous and new component states, then updates only the changed parts.


2. What is React Fiber?
Answer:
React Fiber is the new reconciliation engine introduced in React 16 that enables:

Asynchronous rendering

Pausing and resuming work

Prioritization of UI updates


7. How does React handle Memory Leaks?
Answer:
Memory leaks occur when components subscribe to events but don‚Äôt clean up.

Solution: Cleanup inside useEffect


function Timer() {
  React.useEffect(() => {
    const interval = setInterval(() => console.log("Running..."), 1000);
    return () => clearInterval(interval); // Cleanup
  }, []);

  return <h1>Timer</h1>;
}



10. What is the difference between key and ref in React?
Feature	key	ref
Purpose	Helps React identify items	Accesses DOM elements
Usage	Used in lists (map())	Used for direct DOM manipulation
Example	<li key={id}>	<input ref={inputRef} />
Example Using key in lists:

jsx
Copy
Edit
const items = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"];
items.map((item, index) => <li key={index}>{item}</li>);
Example Using ref to access DOM:

jsx
Copy
Edit
const inputRef = React.useRef(null);
<input ref={inputRef} />;



üï∏Ô∏è Why Is <Suspense> Used in React?
<Suspense> is used to wrap lazy-loaded components (via React.lazy) and display a fallback UI (like a loader or message) while the component is being loaded.
5. What is Suspense and Lazy Loading in React?
Answer:
Suspense is used to handle loading states while fetching data or rendering lazily loaded components.

Lazy loading means loading something only when it is needed, not at the beginning, to make apps faster.

Faster first load: The app starts quickly.

Saves memory and bandwidth.

Improves user experience (especially for big apps).

import React, { lazy, Suspense } from "react";

const LazyComponent = lazy(() => import("./LazyComponent"));

function App() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<h1>Loading...</h1>}>
      <LazyComponent />
    </Suspense>
  );
}


// In React, event handlers are functions that are triggered when a specific event occurs, such as a click, change, hover, or key press. React's event handling is similar to standard DOM event handling but follows the Synthetic Event system, which provides better performance and cross-browser consistency.

// Common React Event Handlers
// Here are some frequently used event handlers in React:

// Event Type	Handler Function	Description
// Click	onClick	Fires when an element is clicked
// Change	onChange	Fires when the value of an input, select, or textarea changes
// Submit	onSubmit	Fires when a form is submitted
// Mouse Enter	onMouseEnter	Fires when the mouse enters an element
// Mouse Leave	onMouseLeave	Fires when the mouse leaves an element
// Key Down	onKeyDown	Fires when a key is pressed
// Key Up	onKeyUp	Fires when a key is released
// Focus	onFocus	Fires when an element gains focus


üîµ What is a Controlled Component in React?
A controlled component is a form element (like <input>, <textarea>, <select>) whose value is controlled by React's state.

React controls what‚Äôs inside the input box.

User types ‚Üí React updates the state ‚Üí State updates the input value.

You must handle onChange to update the value.

‚úèÔ∏è Small Example:
jsx
Copy
Edit
import { useState } from 'react';

function ControlledComponent() {
  const [text, setText] = useState('');

  return (
    <input
      value={text}                 // controlled by state
      onChange={(e) => setText(e.target.value)} // update state on typing
    />
  );
}


 Why Use Controlled Components?
Easy to validate user input.

Easy to disable, clear, or manipulate input programmatically.

Keeps everything in sync inside React.

üîµ What is an Uncontrolled Component in React?
An uncontrolled component is a form element (like <input>, <textarea>, <select>) where the DOM itself manages the value ‚Äî not React.

The input keeps its own value inside the browser automatically.

You use a ref to read the value when you need it.

No need for useState or onChange.

‚úèÔ∏è Small Example:
jsx
Copy
Edit
import { useRef } from 'react';

function UncontrolledComponent() {
  const inputRef = useRef();

  const handleSubmit = () => {
    alert(inputRef.current.value);  // accessing value directly from DOM
  };

  return (
    <>
      <input ref={inputRef} />
      <button onClick={handleSubmit}>Show Value</button>
    </>
  );
}
‚úÖ Here, you don't manage the value in React.
‚úÖ When the user types, the input updates itself.
‚úÖ When you click the button, you read the value using inputRef.current.value.

üõ† Why Use Uncontrolled Components?
Less code for simple forms.

Good for quick tasks where you don't need validation while typing.

Useful when integrating non-React libraries (like plain JavaScript plugins).

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data format used to store and exchange data. It's easy to read and write for humans and machines.

‚úÖ Basic JSON Format Rules:
Data is in key-value pairs.

Keys must be strings (in double quotes).

Values can be:

String

Number

Boolean

null

Array

Another JSON object

üîπ Example of JSON:
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "name": "Alice",
  "age": 25,
  "isStudent": false,
  "skills": ["JavaScript", "React", "Node.js"],
  "address": {
    "city": "New York",
    "zip": "10001"
  }
}
‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes to Avoid:
Keys must be in double quotes: "key", not 'key' or key.

JSON does not support comments.

Trailing commas are not allowed.

In React, a Higher-Order Component (HOC) is a function that takes a component and returns a new component with additional props or behavior. It's a pattern used to reuse component logic


======================

Yes, in React, React.lazy() is used to lazy-load a single component ‚Äî meaning the component is only loaded when it's needed (e.g. when it's rendered), which helps improve initial page load performance.

‚úÖ Basic Usage of React.lazy():
jsx
Copy
Edit
import React, { Suspense } from 'react';

const MyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./MyComponent'));

function App() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <MyComponent />
    </Suspense>
  );
}
üîç Key Points:
React.lazy() accepts a function that returns a dynamic import().

<Suspense> is required to wrap any lazy-loaded component and provides a fallback (like a spinner or loading text).

Useful for code splitting in large applications.

üö´ Not For:
Multiple components at once (use dynamic imports per component).

Server-side rendering (SSR) without additional setup (like with Next.js).

Would you like to see an example using React.lazy() with React Router?

ChatGPT said:
üê¢ When to Use Lazy Loading in React (React.lazy)?
You should use React.lazy() when you want to optimize your app's performance by loading components only when they are needed, instead of all at once during the initial load.

‚úÖ Common Use Cases for Lazy Loading:
Large Components or Modules

Example: Graphs, maps, editors, or charts.

jsx
Copy
Edit
const Editor = React.lazy(() => import('./Editor'));
Route-Based Code Splitting

Load different pages or sections of the app only when a user navigates to them.

jsx
Copy
Edit
const AboutPage = React.lazy(() => import('./pages/About'));
Conditional Rendering

Only load components that may or may not be shown based on a condition.

jsx
Copy
Edit
{showChart && <Chart />}
Admin or Authenticated Areas

Avoid loading admin/user-only parts of the app unless logged in or authorized.

Third-Party Libraries

Delay loading of big dependencies like rich-text editors or analytics tools.

üîÅ Example:
jsx
Copy
Edit
import React, { Suspense } from 'react';

const LazyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./LazyComponent'));

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Main App</h1>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        <LazyComponent />
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
}
üß† Summary:
Use lazy loading in React to reduce initial load time by splitting your app into smaller chunks that load only when needed ‚Äî especially helpful in large apps or apps with many routes.
